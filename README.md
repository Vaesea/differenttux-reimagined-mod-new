# DifferentTux Reimagined

DifferentTux is a mod of SuperTux v0.7. The story should explain things a lot
better.

## Story: Nolok changes the world! In a bad way.

Nolok does an experiment that goes wrong and brings everything to a different 
universe that has nothing to do with Tux Junior except from the fact that somehow, 
there are Tux Junior statues. Anyways, Tux wakes up in this weird universe, thinks 
that Nolok did this (he's correct), and decides to find Nolok. However, Nolok 
already knows what Tux is doing so he goes to a different place this time. How 
does he know? Well in this universe, Nolok has cameras everywhere, and he learns 
that very quickly somehow)

## Installation

Github Actions, for now.

## ACTUALLY PLEASE READ THIS (and the credits too)
Only play the portable version of the Windows version. I recommend doing that using wine if you use Linux.

If you have no other choice, or you don't want to use wine, move your save folder before playing.

Also, don't run "run_supertux.bat", run "run_supertux_portable.bat"

No idea what you're supposed to do on Mac.
